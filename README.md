# Udacity_Material_Design
Training project for practicing Material Design te—Åhniques.
XYZ Reader is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. The app was already functional so the task was to redesign
it with Material Design principles:
- color theme is contrast and attractive and define it in styles.xml
- interface is separated into surfaces
- uses transitions and motion
- uses Design Support Library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc)
- uses CoordinatorLayout for the main activity
- extends from AppCompat
- elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification
- provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements
- uses Picasso to work with imaged without lost of quality
- uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting
